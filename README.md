# ALT RUN

Access the Alt Run app on [Heroku](https://vast-woodland-42106.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

The idea behind this app came from finding that running groups often seem so inclusive and open to everyone. I thought, what if you wanted to run with people who had the same interests or abilities as you, how would you find those people? Alt Run is for those running groups looking to attract people who enjoy the same type of running, post information about the group and a message board for the latest events or questions from other runners.

There is a search function so if you are looking for a specific group by name, location or day of the week.

A user must register and then be logged in before they can add or edit a group, however I have allowed anyone to be able to use the app to browse or search for groups.

## Tech Used

Alt Run uses Ruby in the Sinatra framework. The data is stored in a PostgresSQL database. It also employs Active Record from Rails which speaks to the database which removes the need to code SQL into the app.
